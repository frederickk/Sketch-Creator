Similar to [OpenFrameworks-Project Creator](https://github.com/ofZach/project-creator) and [Cinder-TinderBox](https://github.com/cinder/TinderBox-Mac), this app will create a directory with all dependencies (html, css, js, etc.) required for a [p5.js](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js) project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nA short video showing basic functionality is forthcoming...\r\n\r\n\r\n**Sketch Name**\r\nObvious. The name of your sketch.\r\n\r\n**Sketchbook Location**\r\nThe save location of your sketch. Default is `~/Documents/Processing/` Use the \"...\" to choose a path to desired folder.\r\n\r\n**Events**\r\nCheckboxes for adding hooks for events. Mouse, Touch, and Keyboard are baked into [p5.js](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js). Drag and Drop is my own implementation and not part of the [p5.js](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js) core.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional JavaScript Libraries/Addons**\r\nAdd source files of any additional JavaScript libraries. Load ordering can be adjusted by dragging rows. This means the tool could easily be used for easily scaffolding for other frameworks [two.js](http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/), [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/), etc.\r\n-  Checkbox toggles inclusion of selected library during sketch creation.\r\n- \"...\" change/update path of selected library\r\n- \"+\" add JavaScript library\r\n- \"-\" remove selected library\r\n\r\n**Include bundled CSS styles**\r\nThe included CSS only makes things prettier, it is not required for p5.js.\r\n\r\n**Open in browser on creation**\r\nOpens created sketch within the browser. Chrome is preferred. You can use the browser as an IDE. Chrome is prefferred because on save the browser is refreshed, but Safari works as well. I didn't test Firefox or Opera. (Video forthcoming)\r\n\r\n**Suppress overwrite warnings**\r\nNever see a pop-up warning of overwriting files again. You've been warned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n-------------\r\nCheck out the limited `examples` folder. Head to the home of [p5.js](https://github.com/lmccart/p5.js) for more examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------------\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Ken Frederick\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
